**Abstract**: Financial markets can support the transition to a low-carbon economy by redirecting funds from highly emissive to clean investments. We study whether European stock markets take carbon prices into account in company valuations and to what degree they discriminate between firms with different carbon intensities. Using a novel dataset containing stock prices and carbon intensities of 338 European publicly traded companies between 2013 and 2021, we find a strongly statistically significant relationship between weekly carbon price changes and stock returns. Crucially, this relationship depends on firms’ carbon intensity: the higher the carbon costs a firm faces, the poorer its stock performance during the periods of carbon price increases. Emissions that firms cover with free allowances however do not impact this relationship, illustrating how, in the absence of carbon pricing, data disclosure alone might not be sufficient for financial markets to support climate change mitigation. The relationship we identify can provide an incentive for firms to decarbonize. We argue in favor of more ambitious carbon pricing policies, as this would strengthen the stock-market incentive channel.


## Working papers

1. Explaining Long-Term Bond Yields Synchronization Dynamics in Europe (with Jesús Crespo Cuaresma, submitted). [Working Paper](https://github.com/oscarfergue98/research_files/blob/acb5e166c7a4ce2fc6ad336cfa3535f775a5ee0a/Crespo_Fernandez_2023.pdf). 


**Abstract**: We examine the empirical determinants of sovereign yield synchronization dynamics in the European Monetary Union. Using a time-varying measure of (long-term) government bond yields synchronization and Bayesian Model Averaging methods, we show that the persistence of synchronization measures differs significantly between GIIPS countries (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain) and the rest of the monetary union, as well as across periods characterized by whether the zero lower bound of interest rates was binding or not. The degree of synchronization in inflation rates with the rest of the currency area is a robust predictor of the synchronization of sovereign yields, as opposed to economic fundamentals describing the fiscal positions of individual countries. An out-of-sample forecasting exercise reveals that accounting for synchronization dynamics in economic fundamentals within the monetary union can lead to limited improvements in the directional accuracy in the forecasts of yield synchronization rates. 



2. Financing Costs Over The Business Cycle: Emerging Versus Advanced Economies. [Working Paper](https://github.com/oscarfergue98/research_files/blob/5c91159daba23b89e64e746feba967c50edebe3b/Fernandez_fin_costs.pdf)

**Abstract**: We examine the differences in the response of developed and developing economies to financing cost shocks. By employing empirical methods that exploit the panel structure of the data, we show that real rate shocks have more adverse effects on a set of macroeconomic variables in developing economies than in developed ones. To analyze the structural reasons behind these findings, we propose a theoretical model featuring multiple shocks and frictions that is estimated using data from Brazil and Canada. The results suggest that the interest rate faced by the Brazilian economy in international markets is much more sensitive to deviations in the debt level from its long-run value relative to that of Canada. The spread shock is found to be more volatile in Brazil, and it can explain a substantially higher share of its business cycle. A counterfactual exercise reveals that the volatility of the real rate shock is crucial in determining the relationship between real interest rates and macroeconomic aggregates.
