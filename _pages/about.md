I am Oscar Fernandez Guerra, a Ph.D. candidate at the [Vienna University of Economics and Business](https://www.wu.ac.at/en/) (WU) and a Student Assistant at the [Institute for Advanced Studies Vienna](https://www.ihs.ac.at/) (IHS) at the Macroeconomics and Business Cycles division. I have also provided consultancy work for the [Joint Vienna Institute](https://www.jvi.org/home.html) (JVI). 

## Research Focus
My research interests lie in the field of Macroeconomics, with a special emphasis on the drivers of business cycle fluctuations in emerging and developing economies, and the macroeconomic synchronization dynamics within the European Monetary Union. I am also interested in studying the channels through which the financial sector can promote firms to engage in decarbonisation strategies. With my research, I aim to give answers to these questions from both an empirical and theoretical perspective.
